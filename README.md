# Colorado-Restuarant-Finder
A data analytic report on the feasibility of new restaurants in Colorado.
1.	compile data form the Colorado information marketplace, the Colorado health departments and the Colorado justice department
2.	reduced the dataset “all business entities in Colorado” to only restaurants by using key words such as café, restaurant, pizzeria, bar and grill
3.	geocoded the pared down list of restaurants by location address
4.	cleaned the data, and transformed it so that it would be compatible with vlookup functions.
5.	Exposed the dissolution date that was inexplicably merged into the same cell as the name of the entity
6.	Utilized vlookup to associate the correct economic factors with the correct year by date of founding and dissolution
7.	Created a years active column
8.	Iterated on multiple regression analyses until arriving at the highest possible r squared for the data aggregated so far
